    Change ImmutablesStyle's retention policy

    Change immutablesStyle's retention policy to be SOURCE instead of CLASS.
    Also make SerializableError use it.

    Before this change, any class that's importing an immutable class with @ImmutablesStyle in the package, or directly with @Value.Style(visibility = Value.Style.ImplementationVisibility.PACKAGE), but doesn't add 'org.immutables.value.Value' as compile dependency will get a warning during compilation. This is no longer the case
