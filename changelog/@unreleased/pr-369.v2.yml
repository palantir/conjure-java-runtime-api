  description: |-
    Fixed an annotation used by the immutable classes to not be present on the compiled classes.

    Before this fix, any class that's importing an immutable class with ``@ImmutablesStyle`` in the package
    without 'org.immutables.value.Value' as a compile dependency will receive a warning during compilation time.
    This is no longer the case.
