improvement:
  description: ServiceException retains the `errorInstanceId` from its cause, allowing RemoteExceptions
    to be caught and used as the cause for as more specific ServiceException without sacrificing observability.
    In most cases a single error identifier query is sufficient to discover the root cause of a failure
    instead of individually requesting each segment back to the root.
